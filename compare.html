                    <h3>Cars & Racing Style</h3>
                    <p>F1 is a high-speed open-top car race which usees 1.6L V6 
                        engine cars. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Despite having less engine capacity, F1 cars are more
                        powerful, capable of generating around 1000 BHP. Both
                    </p>
                    <p>Each F1 car is uniquely engineered to suit the individual
                        drivers and typically undergo more development by each team.
                        F1 cars are often very different from one another in both 
                        engineering and performance.

                    <h3>Teams</h3>
                    <p>The F1 teams are: Alfa Romeo, AlphaTauri, Aston Martin,
                        Ferrari, Haas, McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull, and Williams.

                    <h3>Tracks & Races</h3>
                    <p>F1 tracks all have different shapes, with designated tracks
                        and street circuits. These tracks typically have to be of
                        higher grade than those of Indycar. F1 races are international,
                        covering the 5 continents while Indycar races mostly occur in
                        the United States.

                    <h3>Cars & Racing Style</h3>
                    <p>Like F1, Indycar is also a high-speed open-top car race
                        that uses V6 engines in their cars. However, Indycar 
                        engines are slightly larger at 2.2 Liters. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Indycar vehicles are able to push out around 700 BHP.
                        F1 and Indycar are moving towards 100% renewable fuel 
                        sources. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Car engineering is a less important factor in Indycar, 
                        with each team and car running the same chassis. Each
                        car is more similar than different, which means the
                        field is more even on a car performance level.
